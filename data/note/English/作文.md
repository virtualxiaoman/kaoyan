### AI

#### 词组
AI: artificial intelligence(以下文段为简洁起见均用缩写，请结合实际判断是否可以使用缩写)
interactive academic consultations 交互式学术咨询
offer unprecedented scalability in knowledge delivery在知识传递方面提供了前所未有的可扩展性



#### 真·文采句

> 📌**比喻+对比**:AI tutors function like GPS devices, providing clear directions but lacking the ability to perceive when the driver is fatigued. In contrast, human teachers act as **attentive**(贴心的) and **seasoned**(富有经验的) copilots(副驾驶员) who not only guide the journey but also recognize when a break is needed, offering support that fulfills students' emotional and cognitive needs.

#### 开头段

> 📌**机遇**: The **advent** of AI has **profoundly** reshaped campus life, influencing everything from **personalized**(个性化) study plans to AI-assisted information **retrieval**(信息检索), **thereby integrating seamlessly into**(从而无缝融入) students’ daily routines. This rapid integration presents **both unprecedented opportunities and considerable challenges**, particularly for university students preparing to enter an AI-driven world.
In today’s tech-driven era, those proficient in digital skills gain a competitive advantage in learning, careers, and social engagement, as digital competence has shifted from a complementary ability to an essential foundation for navigating modern society.

#### 主体段

##### 优势

> 📌**赋能**： AI **amplifies** human ingenuity, **transforming once-impossible visions into tangible realities.** AI放大了人类的聪明才智，将曾经不可能的愿景/构想变成了可触可及的现实。
**解放**：By automating(自动化) repetitive tasks, AI liberates(解放) us to focus on creativity and **higher-order** thinking(更高层次的思维).
**辅助**: AI serves as a tireless assistant, handling mundane(单调的) tasks and freeing human minds for creative and strategic endeavors.

##### 劣势


> **深度思考**: While AI enhances the efficiency of academic research and **permeates** everyday scholarly tasks, students must **guard against** permitting critical thinking to **yield to** algorithmic **shortcuts**(算法捷径).
📌**深度思考**: When algorithms **devour/erode** our capacity for critical thinking, progress sails like **a ghost ship toward mirages**. 当算法吞噬思考力，进步就像驶向海市蜃楼的幽灵船。
> **决策不透明**: Much like **navigating with a faulty compass**, the opaque decision-making processes of AI systems make it challenging to trace the origins of errors, potentially allowing mistakes to persist and **impeding**(阻碍) effective corrective measures(纠正措施).

guard against: 防止。yield to: 屈从于=give way to。permit sb to do: 允许。

#### 结尾段

> **平衡**: In conclusion, while AI has **undeniably** brought significant advancements to education, enhancing personalization and efficiency, it also presents challenges that deserve careful consideration. Therefore, it is essential for students to harness(控制并利用) the benefits of AI thoughtfully, ensuring that these tools serve to **complement** traditional learning methods rather than replace them. By maintaining a balanced approach, students can continue to develop essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills, preparing them for a future where human insight and technological advancement go hand in hand.
**会提问**: True education occurs not when machines provide answers, but when humans persistently ask better questions.


#### 示例1-以缺点为主
> [AI+教育] 定制化、即时；独立思考、情感互动、隐私、不平等。

   AI has significantly transformed education, offering numerous benefits to students. AI-powered tools provide **customized learning pathways**(定制化学习路径), enabling students to learn at their own pace and according to their individual needs. These technologies also offer immediate feedback, helping students identify and correct mistakes **promptly**(及时地). Furthermore, AI can assist in developing critical thinking skills by presenting challenging problems and scenarios that encourage analytical thinking.
   However, despite these notable(显著的/crucial) advantages, it is **imperative**(必要的) to acknowledge the potential drawbacks **accompanying** the integration of AI into education. Over-reliance on AI tools may **inadvertently**(无意间)  diminish students' capacity for independent thought and problem-solving, as dependence on automated assistance could undermine critical cognitive engagement. Additionally, AI systems **inherently**(天生地) lack emotional intelligence and human interaction, **rendering**(使得) them incapable of providing the encouragement and personalized support that human educators offer. Such interpersonal connections are essential for students' social and emotional development. 📌**Equally concerning are the privacy implications**(倒装句), **given**(因为) that AI applications often necessitate(需要) the collection and analysis of extensive personal data, thereby raising questions about privacy and data security. **Perhaps most critically**(可能最关键的是), the implementation of AI in education may exacerbate existing **inequalities**, as **disparities**(差异) in access to essential technologies and resources can hinder **equitable**(公平的) learning opportunities for all students.
   In conclusion, while AI presents promising opportunities to enhance educational quality, it is essential to **approach**(处理) its integration thoughtfully(认真地), ensuring that it **complements**(补充) traditional teaching methods and addresses the associated challenges(解决相关挑战) to provide equitable and effective education for all students.

这里倒装句是**表语前置**引起的完全倒装，表语+系动词+主语，相当于The privacy implications are equally concerning.还可以改为：Equally concerning are the privacy implications arising from AI applications, which often necessitate...
更生动的同义表达: AI systems inherently lack the human touch(人情味) — they can't offer the kind of personal encouragement a teacher gives when a student struggles, nor can they **pick up on**(注意到) **subtle cues**(细微的线索) like **a frustrated sigh or hesitant body language** to adjust their approach.



### 学习


#### 示例1-过程拆分

   To increase the likelihood of success, one should **set realistic goals** and work **persistently** towards them. **This principle holds true because** unrealistic ambitions often lead to frustration, **whereas**(但是) attainable targets foster motivation and measurable progress. Furthermore, breaking a larger goal into smaller tasks can offer **regular feedback and a sense of accomplishment**, which helps sustain enthusiasm and momentum throughout the process.
   Moreover, persistent effort **bridges the gap between goals and achievement**(架桥). For instance, a student aiming to master a complex subject within a month may feel overwhelmed; however, by breaking it into weekly milestones and receiving regular feedback, they build confidence through progressive accomplishment. This approach transforms **daunting**(令人畏惧的) tasks into manageable steps, thus sustaining motivation. Thomas Edison’s thousands of experiments before inventing the lightbulb further **exemplify how unwavering commitment transforms setbacks into stepping stones**(坚定的投入化挫折为垫脚石). Without such **resilience**, even well-designed plans **remain** unfulfilled dreams.
   Therefore, combining practical goal-setting with **unceasing** effort is essential. Only by doing so can individuals **navigate challenges**(应对挑战), reinforce progress through continual feedback, and ultimately attain truly fulfilling achievements that stand the test of time(经得起时间的考验).




### 反思与成长
When students fail an exam, it's **inherently human** to feel disappointed or even regretful, but what truly matters is how they **bounce back**/(**pick themselves up**) and learn from the experience. Embracing a growth mindset allows them to view setbacks as opportunities for improvement, fostering resilience and determination.
Ultimately, it's not the failure itself that **defines** them, but their response to it that shapes their future success.

Graduates at the Crossroads
    The illustration **vividly depicts** a group of graduates standing at a crossroads, confronted with multiple **divergent**(分叉的) paths labeled "job seeking", "postgraduate entrance exam", "studying abroad" and "entrepreneurship." This 📌**thought-provoking** image **reflects**/**highlights** the **diverse**(多元化的) opportunities available to contemporary graduates, yet it also **implies**/**indicates** the challenges of decision-making in an era of abundant possibilities.

>> You are going to host a club reading session. Write an email of about 100  words recommending a book to the club members.
You should state reasons for your recommendation. 

Dear Club Members,
    I hope this message finds you well. With our upcoming reading session approaching, I am delighted to recommend Ernest Hemingway's timeless classic, *The Old Man and the Sea*.
    This masterpiece profoundly moved me through its vivid portrayal of resilience. The protagonist Santiago, despite enduring 84 days without a catch, ventures into the sea alone. His relentless struggle against a colossal marlin and subsequent battle with sharks epitomizes the indomitable human spirit. Though he ultimately loses the fish, Santiago's unwavering perseverance in the face of overwhelming adversity offers a powerful metaphor for our academic challenges.
    I believe this novel will inspire us to confront obstacles with courage. Its profound themes of dignity and endurance are particularly relevant to our journey as students. I eagerly anticipate discussing its insights with you all.
                                                                                                                                                                                 Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                                                             Li Ming

The illustration poignantly depicts a gathering where individuals are engrossed in their mobile phones, oblivious to face-to-face interaction—a scenario both commonplace and concerning.

While smartphones bridge geographical divides, their pervasive use ironically erodes authentic human connection. The devices themselves are neutral; however, excessive reliance on digital communication diminishes our capacity for in-person dialogue. Emojis and text messages, though convenient, often replace nuanced emotional expression, gradually impairing our ability to articulate feelings without technological crutches. Should this trend persist, we risk forfeiting essential social skills.

Thus, smartphones epitomize a double-edged sword. To mitigate their detrimental impact, individuals must consciously prioritize real-world engagement. Setting aside devices during social interactions fosters richer communication, where spoken words carry warmth and authenticity unmatched by digital exchanges. Embracing this balance ensures technology enhances, rather than supplants, human bonds.
